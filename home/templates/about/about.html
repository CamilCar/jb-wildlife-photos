                    Iâ€™m a passionate wildlife photographer who spends every free minute I have outside, looking for wild animals.

                    2020 I bought my first camera and started my hobby as photographer. In the beginning I mostly took pictures of landscapes while trying to learn the camera settings.

                    Close by where I used to live back then, there were groups of roe deer's out in the fields almost every evening. I wanted to photograph them, but with the lens I had
                    at the time I could never get close enough.
                    So, within my first months as a photographer, I bought a new lens with better zoom. When I took my first photos of wildlife, my interest in photography and nature grew, and it became my passion.

                    Since then, I have been on several photographic expeditions, including Finland for bears, and Norway for musk oxen and puffins.
